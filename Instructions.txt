Instructions to use this project:

1. Move the trailers you want to "palettize" into the trailer_videos folder.

2. Run create_frames.py. The program will automatically create a folder filtered_frames that hold the sliced frames for
   each trailer. No input arguments are required.

3. After create_frames.py has finished running, run process_frames.py. The program will automatically create a folder
   color_palettes that hold the visualized palettes for each trailer. This program can take an exceptionally long time
   to run depending on the processing power of the machine. No input arguments are required.

4. (Optional) This project is currently configured in an experimental mode where only palette images are produced for
   visualization but the palette colours are not saved. To export palette colours, first decide upon a single pair of
   saliency/saturation weights and modify the w global array in kmeans_color_palette.py to have length 1. Uncomment any
   commented code in process_frames.py. The palette values for each trailer run by process_frames.py will be exported
   to a single csv file palette.csv in the directory, and there is code written to prevent duplication as well as
   sorting the entries after new palettes are added.

P.S. Cropping dimensions from remove_MPAA_frames() from slicer.py can be buggy depending on the trailer you're using.
     If it doesn't work as expected I would suggest taking a look at how dimension_1, dimension_2, and dimension_3
     are created and tweak the code to get the frame you want to use as your crop dimensions.
